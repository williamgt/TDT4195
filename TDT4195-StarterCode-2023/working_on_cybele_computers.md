There are 25 computers in Cybele (the lab previously known as Tulipan), all with powerful GPU cards (RTX 4090).


## Environment
Every computer in the cybele lab comes with python2 and python3.
You can run code in python3 by using, `python3 my_program.py`.

```bash
pip3 --user install package_name
```
